Why Should You Be Hired For This Internship.?

	Since I am a fresher, I am still learning. But I can vouch for the fact that I am a fast learner. I am always open to learn and unlearn at the same time. Unlearning as in letting go of outdated practices and ideas and moving on to more advanced procedures. I have some fresh and raw ideas that I would like to discuss with the management here if I make through and I am sure they will like a few of them. Hiring me can be a mutually beneficial arrangement for this company and me. I donâ€™t see why I cannot be hired for this internship.
